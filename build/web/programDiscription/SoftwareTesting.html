    <p>The Software Testing and Quality Assurance program has been engineered for professionals who are seeking to
        set foot in the world of software testing and quality compliance.

<p> Software testing technicians conduct trials of newly-developed software for employers, ranging from software 
    publishers and video game developers to financial institutions and medical research companies. The primary 
    objective of a Software Testing and Quality Assurance professional is to detect bugs and performance issues before
    a product reaches the consumer. The common approach for software testers is to develop and run software test plans, 
    interact with design teams and to submit detailed reports of their findings.
</p>
<p> As the computer industry shows no signs of slowing down its output of new software, the job outlook for Software
    Testing and Quality Assurance is extremely bright. As programs become increasingly advanced and the world becomes more
    dependent on technology, the demand for Software Testing and Quality Assurance jobs will continue to increase.
    This program guides you through all the latest techniques to function in this area of expertise and places you 
    on a fast career trajectory in quality assurance.
