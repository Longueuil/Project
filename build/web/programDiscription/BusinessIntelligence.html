    <p align="center">  Program Overview</p>
    <p>
Business Intelligence is one of the most vibrant and dynamic fields of IT in North America. 
Companies understood the important of managing and using internal and external data to make better decisions.
A wide spectrum of specialties and roles were defined to make sure that the data used in organizations is clean,
managed and properly used by executives, management and analysts.
</p> 
<p> 
Our Business Intelligence Program was built, and is continuously updated, with BI professionals and organizations
in Montreal. To stay relevant, and to offer the best chances to our students, our teachers / 
BI experts will follow your learning path in small, personalized classes and using the technologies that are now 
in use in the field. Our approach is hands on, with lots of labs, practice projects and a final project. 
This is to ensure that you have what it takes to face an interview and land a job as a BI developer or analyst.
</p> 
<p> 
The program is offered in collaboration with Microsoft IT academy and Oracle WDP programs,
using their most recent technology software and curriculum, preparing students for their future career in Business 
Intelligence.
</p>
<p> 
The Business Intelligence and Visualization Analyst program is designed for students wishing to follow a
fast-tracked career path in Business Intelligence. </p>
